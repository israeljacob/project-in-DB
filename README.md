# Mini-Project in DB using PL/SQL

This mini-project demonstrates the use of PL/SQL for various database operations such as creating tables, inserting, updating, and deleting data, generating test data, creating indexes, executing complex queries, managing permissions through grants, creating views, implementing functions and procedures, designing triggers, and generating reports and graphs.

## Project Overview

The goal of this mini-project is to showcase the use of PL/SQL in various database-related tasks. It covers a wide range of operations and features that can be performed using PL/SQL, including table creation, data manipulation (insertion, updating, and deletion), generating test data, creating indexes for performance optimization, executing complex queries, managing permissions with grants, creating views for data abstraction, implementing functions and procedures for reusability, designing triggers for automated actions, and generating reports and graphs for data analysis.
